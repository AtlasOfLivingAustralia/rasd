<p><em>(Version 1/12/2022)</em></p>
<p>This supplement provides sample clauses to be included in legal agreements either between data custodians or between data custodians and data receivers under the RASD Framework. Data receivers may be Approved Data Requestors or, in the case of data access requests between data custodians, the requesting data custodian.</p>
<p>These clauses address:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the duration of the agreement</p></li>
<li><p>citation of the dataset</p></li>
<li><p>third-party Intellectual Property (IP)</p></li>
<li><p>the requirement that data are held in a secure environment with role-based access controls where necessary</p></li>
<li><p>whether data can be passed onto third parties with or without consent of the data custodian</p></li>
<li><p>that data to be used for the purposes outlined in the agreements only and not for any other purpose</p></li>
<li><p>the consequences if a breach of agreement conditions occurs including suspension of current and future access requests</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In these sample clauses capitalised words are terms that should be defined in the negotiated agreement. It is important to clearly identify the “Data” that are the subject of the agreement.</p>
<p>The sample clauses use the terms “Supplier” and “Receiver”. For agreements between a data custodian and an Approved Data Requestor, the Supplier is the data custodian and the Receiver is an Approved Data Requestor. Text in <strong>[square brackets]</strong> needs to be replaced when the agreement is being prepared.</p>

2. Notwithstanding clause 1, if any personal information is incorporated in the Data, each party must, in dealing with that personal information:<br>
(a) promptly notify the Supplier that the Data includes personal information;<br>

(b) After receiving the written request under paragraph (a) and subject to paragraph (c) below, the Supplier will use reasonable efforts to provide the updates of the Data promptly.<br>
(c) The Receiver acknowledges that the updates of the Data may contain data (such as Indigenous data or -party data) that requires changes to the conditions placed on the use of Data under this Agreement. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to vary this Agreement before the updates to the Data are released.</td>

<br>
If there is Indigenous data contained within the Data, any conditions requested by Indigenous peoples should be stipulated here.</p>
<p>Note regarding “commercial purposes”: if commercial purposes are to be excluded, consider whether this needs to be defined. In particular, if the Receiver is a forprofit it may be necessary to carve out specific commercial uses that are not permitted.</p></td>

(a) <strong>[stipulate any matters for which Indigenous peoples requested to be consulted e.g.&nbsp;commercial purposes or aggregation with other datasets for the purpose of publication]</strong></td>
<td>Data Custodians will need to consult with Indigenous peoples prior to release of Data containing Indigenous data. In some cases, Indigenous peoples might agree to the use of Indigenous data for certain purposes. If so, those conditions can be listed in the clause in the row above (“Are there restrictions on the use of the Data?”)<br>

However, in most cases, it will be appropriate for the Receiver to consult with Indigenous peoples before certain uses are made. Such conditions should be addressed in this clause.</td>

</em>- Role: Uses the Data for the Purpose (or aspects of the Purpose)<br>
- Access rights: Able to query and analyse but not edit the Data. Able to create and publish Derived Products. Able to integrate and query Data with other datasets.<br>

2. The Receiver must maintain a record of Authorised Users, roles assigned to each Authorised User (as provided in clause 1) and what Data are accessible to each Authorised User.<br>
<br>
3. The Receiver must ensure that each Authorised User is only given the Access Rights and the Data that the Authorised User needs for their role.<br>
<br>
4. Before the Receiver provides Authorised Users with access to Data:<br>
(a) the Receiver must ensure that Authorised Users understand and are able to comply with the Data use obligations in this Agreement; and<br>
(b) the Receiver must maintain a documented record (co-signed by the Administrator and the general user or developer, as applicable) of the Authorised User’s understanding, including a description of the Data use obligations.</td>
<td>In some cases, more than one individual within a Receiver’s organisation will need access to the Data. In such cases a clause should be included to specify how Data should be managed by the Receiver.<br>

<br>
<u>Where Data can be provided to third parties<br>
</u><br>
<strong>[Option A]</strong><br>
(a) If the Receiver wishes to pass Data received under this Agreement to a third-party, the Receiver must first obtain the express written permission of the Supplier. The Supplier may withhold permission at the Supplier’s discretion.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Option B]</strong><br>
(a) The Receiver may pass Data received under this Agreement to a third-party provided that the Receiver first notifies the Supplier of the third-party.<br>
(b) Before any Data are provided to a third-party, the Receiver must:<br>
(i) enter into a written agreement on terms that are similar to, consistent with and at least as onerous as the terms of this Agreement; and (ii) ensure that:<br>
A. no legal restrictions on the use of the Data are breached by providing the Data;<br>
B. the Data are cited and attributed correctly; and<br>
C. the Data does not contain any Personal Information.</td>
<td>A clause should be included to address whether Data – that is, the <strong>untransformed</strong> Data received from the Data Custodian – can be provided to third parties.<br>
<br>
If Data can be provided to third parties, the clause should specify the circumstances under which Data may be transferred.<br>

Two potential approaches are suggested. Another approach would be to permit Data to be passed on to certain categories of third parties or for certain usages only.</td>
