    "section": "",
    "text": "Restricted Access Species Data (RASD) - often known as “sensitive species data” – are data about biodiversity that have features that mean there are reasons for withholding the data from public view or modifying the data before it is made public.\nThis can include, for example:\n\nFlora and fauna where knowledge about their exact locations make them sensitive to disturbance. This can be because they are extremely rare, attractive to poachers, their nest sites are highly sensitive to disturbance or simply because they are newly discovered and there is insufficient information known about them.\nSpecies locations where knowledge about the species can be seriously misinterpreted or cause damage without context. Examples include records of weed or pest control that the landowner might not be comfortable making publicly available. An important example is records of an invasive species that has been eradicated from Australia but whose historical records might cause confusion over Australia’s pest-free status.\nData that have been supplied under conditions that constrain what can be given to third parties or where the data can threaten research or an economic outcome.\nData that include personal identifiable information, where the person has not given approval for that data to be shared.\nData that has been gathered by or otherwise belongs to First Nations people and permission needs to be granted before the data are shared.\n\nThis data is needed for conservation management, decision-making and research.\nAn excellent overview of many types of sensitive data, the current state of play internationally, as well as the issues inherent in using these data are provided by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility’s Current Best Practices for Generalizing Sensitive Species Occurrence Data by Arthur Chapman."

Many of the principles and best practices outlined in this framework could, however, be applied when handling access requests for these data. The framework is intended to operate within the CARE principles for Indigenous data governance to recognise Indigenous data sovereignty."

It was also agreed that a move away from the use of the term “sensitive” was helpful in understanding all the types of restrictions that influence data custodian decisions on sharing data as well as avoiding confusion with formal Australian government security classifications.\nThe purpose of this framework is to:\na) provide principles to facilitate a consistent national approach to RASD\nb) provide overarching principles and best practice guidance to data custodians on identifying, managing, and sharing RASD\nc) provide technical guidance on how to operationally deal with RASD\nd) emphasise the principle that data custodians retain sovereignty over their data\nThe framework provides a national, structured, best-practice flow for:\na) the sharing of all RASD\nb) the release of data to approved data requestors\nc) the release of desensitised and modified datasets for use by the general community\nd) agreed best-practice processes enabling a)-c)"
