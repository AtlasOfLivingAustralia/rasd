    "text": "Restricted Access Species Data (RASD) - often known as “sensitive species data” – are data about biodiversity that have features that mean there are reasons for withholding the data from public view or modifying the data before it is made public.\nThis can include, for example:\n\nFlora and fauna where knowledge about their exact locations make them sensitive to disturbance. This can be because they are extremely rare, attractive to poachers, their nest sites are highly sensitive to disturbance or simply because they are newly discovered and there is insufficient information known about them.\nSpecies locations where knowledge about the species can be seriously misinterpreted or cause damage without context. Examples include records of weed or pest control that the landowner might not be comfortable making publicly available. An important example is records of an invasive species that has been eradicated from Australia but whose historical records might cause confusion over Australia’s pest-free status.\nData that have been supplied under conditions that constrain what can be given to third parties or where the data can threaten research or an economic outcome.\nData that include personal identifiable information, where the person has not given approval for that data to be shared.\nData that has been gathered by or otherwise belongs to First Nations people and permission needs to be granted before the data are shared.\n\nThis data is needed for conservation management, decision-making and research.\nAn excellent overview of many types of sensitive data, the current state of play internationally, as well as the issues inherent in using these data are provided by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility’s Current Best Practices for Generalizing Sensitive Species Occurrence Data by Arthur Chapman."

    "text": "Sensitive Species or Restricted Access Species Lists (RASLs)\nRASLs, also known as sensitive species lists, are lists of species that are regarded as requiring protection from human interference for a variety of reasons. They can include both listed threatened species as well as unlisted species that have some aspect that makes them sensitive, for example, poaching from nest sites. Typically, the decision to classify a species as sensitive is balanced against the potential cost and disadvantages of hiding locality information and potentially impairing conservation efforts. Some RASLs only affect species records at certain times of the year or certain life stages, for example Birdlife Australia treats some RASL species records as sensitive only during breeding season.\nMaintaining up-to-date, public, discoverable RASLs supports better and more efficient decision- making, and more informed use and management of data.\nRASLs are maintained by all state and territory environmental agencies in Australia. Most jurisdictional RASLs are publicly available lists that delineate which species should have their geographic locations blurred (see obfuscation) or withheld entirely to prevent disturbance or exploitation of the species or the site.\nSome custodians of large species-specific datasets such as BirdLife Australia, FrogID and Butterflies Australia also maintain RASLs derived from expert opinion.\nLastly, large data aggregators also use these RASLs, for example the Atlas of Living Australia applies both jurisdictional and third-party RASLs to data."

In the following example Figure 1 (figure one taken from Chapman 2020), two alternative means of taking individual observations and generalising them to a grid are shown.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: (Taken from Chapman 2020 – please note that this is not figure one in this framework)\n\n\nEither of the above generalisation techniques, rounding (A) or the provision of records as grid square polygons (B) are preferred, if data are to be passed between systems that may then apply their own additional obfuscation.

These are:\n\n2.3.1 3.1 Legal Contract –\nA dataset containing information that has legal conditions over its use. This might include a negotiated legal contract or a standard form data licence agreement that in effect is a legal contract limiting the transfer of the data to a third-party. Examples include data gathered under a signed contract with a third-party contractor or data from a research project provided under legal or licence agreement that relates to control of third-party data use. This limits who else the data can be shared with. It does not concern data where there are informal agreements in place.\n\n\n2.3.2 3.2 Legal Financial –\nA dataset that is commercial-in-confidence until an economic decision has been made or is part of current financial negotiations whereby transfer could compromise a financial process such as a tender. Such data are normally subject to an embargo period after which it may be released. For example, a company has access to data about endangered species in relation to a development they are involved with where third-party knowledge of that data (by competitors) might impact the economic viability of the project. This dataset might be embargoed until a certain date.\n\n\n2.3.3 3.3 Non-legal –\nA dataset that was acquired via an informal agreement that the information would not be transferred. Typically, this relates to third parties such as data from a landholder, data from a researcher who has not yet published or similar. As an example, a researcher working on a PhD project has a significant number of observations about a new species. The researcher is happy to share the data but does not want the data to be made public until after the publication of their results. An alternative example might be a researcher’s data where the location can be revealed but other fields such as measurements must be withheld. This dataset might be embargoed until a certain date."

Species-related categories are:\n\n2.4.1 4.1. Location data –\nA dataset that contains species where access to information about their exact location causes sensitivity. This includes:\n\ndivulging exact location of a species where factors such as geographically restricted distribution, recent discovery, life history stage, reproductive habits, feeding habits or vulnerability to human interference may compromise conservation / management efforts where that information is not already in the public domain. Most jurisdictions and major data custodians maintain sensitive species lists containing species that meet this definition which require active record management. For example, the exact location of a critically endangered plant or animal is withheld to prevent exploitation, theft for illegal trade, vandalism, the risk of disease posed by visitation and habitat destruction.\n\nmanagement factors that make the record sensitive. This includes records on private land that interfere with privacy, or where the records are sensitive. To protect the plant, animal, habitat, or people, coordinates for the species are obfuscated.\n\n\nFor both i) and ii), an alternative to obfuscating or withholding the record, may be to accurately communicate the location but obfuscate the identification of the species, to avoid incidental damage such as to a nest tree in a forestry harvesting plan or roadside spraying and slashing.\n\n\n2.4.2 4.2 Identification data –\nSpecies whose identification has major economic, legal, or financial ramifications at a jurisdictional level, if the species name or location is exposed. This particularly refers to species which, if reported, are extremely sensitive, causing major issues at state, territory, or national scale. For example, there are highly invasive species that are spreading internationally that do not occur in Australia. These species present potential major biosecurity risks to Australian natural resource industries such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries and Australia’s unique plants and animals. Incursions of these species are dealt with swiftly and decisively by eradication. However, publicly available historical records about an incursion that was wiped out can cause confusion over whether the species is active in Australia. Locations of incursions for these species may be withheld for the economic well-being of a jurisdiction.\n\n\n2.4.3 4.3 Attribute data –\nData where metadata about the record in one or more attribute fields adds additional sensitivity. This generally means that the species record itself is not sensitive, but there is information attached to the record, such as breeding information, that make it easy to disturb the animal or important elements of its habitat. Other examples include culturally sensitive information or the location of pest control activities e.g. baiting / poisoning programs that the landowner might be worried about sharing because of tampering with baits. This may require similar approaches to location related data, where the location must be accurately communicated but species identity obfuscated."

    "text": "4.5 Receiving Access Requests\nThe Australian Best Practice Guide to Applying Data Sharing Principles suggests the logical fields for a data request. Requests for RASD should meet the following criteria:\n\ndefine a geographic / taxonomic area of interest – the request form should ask data requestors to define the geographic / taxonomic extent of their request.\n\ndemonstrate an appropriate aim – the request should clearly articulate the aim of the intended use. For research, the aim should include a statement on the topic of the research; for industry use, the request should specify the type of activity data are being sought for.\n\ndemonstrate a public benefit – the request should clearly articulate what public benefit is derived by accessing the data and the expected outputs and outcomes.\n\nshow that legal, ethical, and moral considerations (including CARE principles) have been addressed – how should the request ensure that the data are not misused? Particularly, the data requestor has to make a statement on how they should protect the data from being accessed inappropriately.\n\nstate what data should be used and why it’s required - the request should clearly articulate for what purpose RASD is required. For research, this should include a description of the project and expected outcomes; for industry use, the request should specify the type of activity and location.\n\nstate the timeframes for which the user needs the data\n\nstate who (both the entity requesting the data and nominated responsible individual within the entity) will be working on the project\n\ndemonstrate feasibility – the data requestor needs to demonstrate that the requested data are suitable for answering the stated aims of the project.\n\n\nNormally, requests meeting criteria and requesting access to a localised geographic area, or data for a single or small group of species should be approved. Requests for data at a jurisdictional or national level should receive greater scrutiny.\nAn objective of data requests under the framework should be to prevent restricted data being passed to third parties or entering the public domain.\nA best practice guide to fields for an electronic form meeting these requirements is available in Supplement 9.\nIf a data requestor has identified as an Indigenous body or organisation on the data access request form, and they have not previously been subject to a breach, every effort should be made by the data custodians to facilitate the sharing of data with the requestor."

There are several levels of access for these users:\n\naccess to the entire dataset for a specified period – this normally covers high-level use such as contractors working for government on a specific project or research institutions conducting extended studies who need access either to the entire dataset or all data from a particular jurisdiction. Usage terminates at the end of the specified period\n\naccess to a subset of the dataset (e.g. a specified local area or all data relating to a species or group of species for a specified period) – this covers most use cases from research and commercial end users\n\naccess to a protected environment where data can be queried but not copied – this covers the alternative to level two, where commercial interests or research users wanting relatively fast access to large datasets can enter a protected environment, interrogate data, but not download a copy. Derived products such as models may be downloaded (this option is currently not widely available)\n\n\nGenerally speaking, individuals should not be recognised as Approved Data Requestors because of the legal complexities surrounding data access. This means a university school, rather than a PhD student, would be signatory, with the expectation that the university will take responsibility for ensuring that the student uses the data legally and responsibly. All Approved Data Requestors should preferably only be able to acquire data if they sign a negotiated legal agreement (not a standard form data licence agreement) controlling data use (Supplement 2 and Principle: Sharing or Restricted Access Species Data Should be Through Negotiated Legal Agreement.\nInstances where Approved Data Requestors breach legal agreement conditions may result in the Requestor having their agreement revoked.

It is the responsibility of data custodians and users to familiarise themselves with any relevant breach reporting requirements in their jurisdiction, and for custodians to determine what constitutes a serious breach.\nData requestors that have been assessed consistently with the principles of this framework as Approved Data Requestors may, on occasion, breach the conditions of their negotiated legal agreement for data use. Breaches should be dealt with by the data custodian responsible for the agreement consistent with the conditions of the agreement.\nWhere serious or multiple breaches occur, it is in the interests of data custodians to warn other data custodians of known offenders and take this into consideration in approving new data requests. In the case of a current negotiated legal agreement, the agreement should be cancelled immediately.\nAn appeals process should be set up by the data custodian for approved data requestors to appeal any breaches or rejections of data access requests."

It provides a stable standard reference for sharing information on biodiversity. The terms used in the standard are a part of a larger set of vocabularies and technical specifications under development and maintained by the Biodiversity Information Standards Group (also known by the abbreviation TDWG). TDWG is an international reference group. Its previous title was the Taxonomic Databases Working Group (hence the acronym).\n\n\nData Custodians\nThe managers of data repositories. For the purposes of this Framework, data custodians comprise any data custodians that have decided to operate consistent with this framework.\n\n\nData Requestor\nA user requesting data that has not yet been assessed under this framework.

For the purposes of this framework, it largely refers to documentation of the sensitivity status of the record (or the species of which it is a part) along with access constraints pertaining to the record and details of any generalisation of the data\n\n\nNational Framework for the Sharing of Restricted Access Species Data in Australia\nThis framework. A set of guidelines for data custodians providing best practice guidance.\n\n\nNegotiated Legal Agreement\nFor the purposes of this framework, a legal agreement between data custodians and Approved Data Requestors, the terms of which are negotiated by the parties. This framework encourages the use of these agreements instead of Standard Form Data Licence Agreements.\n\n\nNew Data\nData acquired after a data custodian has decided to act consistently with this framework.\n\n\nObfuscation\nThe practise of rounding or randomising, according to an agreed standard, the geo- localities in a dataset to make it difficult to discern the original geo-locality. Randomisation has benefits for map display but is not a robust data management approach in a data ecosystem. Rounding or the provision of records as grid square polygons is preferred if data are to be passed between systems that may then apply their own additional obfuscation. For the purposes of this framework and the best practice guide, references to obfuscation imply rounding or the provision of records as grid square polygons, not randomisation.\n\n\nOrganisations operating and referencing this framework\nOrganisations that state publicly or reference that their processes are consistent with this framework.\n\n\nPersonal Identifiable Information\nData that meets the definition of private information under any of the Commonwealth, State or Territory legislative or regulatory definitions. For the purposes of Restricted Access Species Data, generally names and/or contact details held in third-party datasets where the record contributor has not given permission for the sharing of their data. Discussed in full in Supplement 3.\n\n\nRaw Data\nRestricted Access Species (RASD) as stored by the data custodian including Personal Identifiable Information.\n\n\nRegistered Business\nA legal entity with a registered Australian Business Number. May be a government, non-government, or research organisation, or a business.\n\n\nRestricted Access Species Data (RASD)\nFor the purposes of this framework, RASD are any dataset or record related to species that is determined to contain restricted access or sensitive information (data class or geolocational) as defined by this framework that should not be shared openly. RASD categories are defined in Table 1.\n\n\nRestricted Access Species List (RASL)\nRASLs, also known as sensitive species lists, are maintained by each jurisdiction in Australia. A jurisdictional RASL is a publicly available list that delineates which species should have their geographic locations blurred or obfuscated to prevent disturbance or exploitation of the species or the site. In addition, Third-party data custodians (including individuals) may have their own RASLs.\n\n\nSpecies\nIn the context of this framework, species refer to all species, subspecies or infraspecies, including (where identified under RASLs) populations, varieties, and phrase name taxa.\n\n\nStandard Form Data Licence Agreement\nA license used between most data custodians and repositories, which uses standard (non-negotiable) terms and conditions to stipulate management of data including to control end user use of data.\n\n\nTransformation\nThe practice of modifying the fields or data in a dataset. For the purpose of this framework:\nTransformation involves:\n(i) the bulk manipulation of data to desensitise for exchange or sharing, including obfuscation;\nRemovals include one or more of the following:\n(i) removing Personal Identifiable Information\n(ii) removing fields containing sensitive data (other than Personal Identifiable Information)\n(iii) removing rows containing sensitive data (other than Personal Identifiable Information)\n(iv) temporarily removing data held under an embargo\n(v) removing data with legal or identification constraints\nFlagging includes one or more of the following:\n\nadjustment of “local” taxonomy to an agreed national standard (while retaining local taxonomy as well)\n\nflagging of suspect records.\n\n\n\nWithheld Data\nData which does not leave a Data Custodian’s database at all UNLESS relevant transformations metadata and removals outlined in this framework are applied.
