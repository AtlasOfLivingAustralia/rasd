# Who Manages this Framework?  {.unnumbered}

This framework is maintained by the Atlas of Living Australia in consultation with the national community of practice, the Australian Biodiversity Information Governance Group (AusBIGG), which includes representatives from the jurisdictions around Australia as well as the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network, the Atlas of Living Australia, the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria, and the Council of Heads of Australian Fauna Collections.

The framework will be reviewed after 12 months and then updated every three years following consultation processes.

A high-level view of how this framework interacts with data custodians and users is shown in @fig-1.
