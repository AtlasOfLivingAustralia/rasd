          When you register to establish an account with the RASDS as a data requestor or a data custodian, you will be
          asked to provide your first name, your last name and your email address. This personal information is being
          collected by CSIRO, with your consent, so we can establish your account with the RASDS and facilitate data
          access requests via the RASDS.

          If you do not provide all the information that is requested on the registration form, it may not be possible
          for us to establish your account with the RASDS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once registered, data custodians can use the RASDS to track and manage requests for restricted access species
          data. Registered data requestors can use the RASDS to request full-resolution restricted access species data
          from one or multiple data custodians.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to facilitate data access requests, the personal information you provide as a data requestor may need
          to be provided to data custodians. However, your express consent will be sought prior to any provision of
          personal information to a third party.

            The RASDS website is operated by Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) without the use of an external service
            provider. When visiting the RASDS website, a record of your visit is logged. The following information is
            supplied by your browser or recorded by our servers:

            This site visit data may be aggregated for analysis with identifiable characteristics removed. We may

            the RASDS funding body, the Australian Research Data Commons. No attempt will be made to identify users or
            their browsing activities except in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency
            may exercise a warrant to inspect the server's logs.
