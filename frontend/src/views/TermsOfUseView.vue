      <p class="has-text-justified py-1">
        By using this RASDS website and the Content available on and through it, you are agreeing to be bound by these
        Terms of Use and the <RouterLink :to="{ name: 'privacy-notice' }">Privacy Notice.</RouterLink>
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-justified py-1">
        Content that you access through the RASDS website may also be subject to specific terms and conditions imposed
        by a data custodian (Data Custodian Terms). These Data Custodian Terms may include legal agreements to access
        restricted access species data. Some example terms are provided in the
        <a href="https://rasd.org.au/pdf-html/supplement2.html">
          Restricted Access Species Data Framework - Supplement: What Legal Clauses Should be Included in a Restricted
          Access Species Data Negotiated Licence Agreement?
        </a>
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-justified py-1">
        The Data Custodian Terms and the Terms of Use form the legally binding agreement between you, RASDS and/or the
        data custodian. If there is any inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Data Custodian Terms then the
        Data Custodian Terms will prevail, but only to the extent that it applies to the particular content and to the
        extent necessary to resolve any conflict.
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-justified py-1">
        The ultimate decision regarding requests to access restricted access species data is the sole responsibility of
        the Data Custodian, not the RASDS. The RASDS accepts no responsibility for any decisions made by the Data
        Custodian pertaining to requests to access restricted access species data.
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-justified py-1 pb-5">
        The RASDS reserves the right to assess the validity of requests to register as a data custodian and make
        decisions pertaining to these requests.
