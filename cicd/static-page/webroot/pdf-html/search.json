    "text": "Restricted Access Species Data (RASD) - often known as “sensitive species data” – are data about biodiversity that have features that mean there are reasons for withholding the data from public view or modifying the data before it is made public.\nThis can include, for example:\n\nFlora and fauna where knowledge about their exact locations make them sensitive to disturbance. This can be because they are extremely rare, attractive to poachers, their nest sites are highly sensitive to disturbance or simply because they are newly discovered and there is insufficient information known about them.\nSpecies locations where knowledge about the species can be seriously misinterpreted or cause damage without context. Examples include records of weed or pest control that the landowner might not be comfortable making publicly available. An important example is records of an invasive species that has been eradicated from Australia but whose historical records might cause confusion over Australia’s pest-free status.\nData that have been supplied under conditions that constrain what can be given to third parties or where the data can threaten research or an economic outcome.\nData that include personal identifiable information, where the person has not given approval for that data to be shared.\nData that has been gathered by or otherwise belongs to First Nations people and permission needs to be granted before the data are shared.\n\nThis data is needed for conservation management, decision-making and research.\nAn excellent overview of many types of sensitive data, the current state of play internationally, as well as the issues inherent in using these data are provided by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility’s Current Best Practices for Generalizing Sensitive Species Occurrence Data by Arthur Chapman."

    "text": "Sensitive Species or Restricted Access Species Lists (RASLs)\nRASLs, also known as sensitive species lists, are lists of species that are regarded as requiring protection from human interference for a variety of reasons. They can include both listed threatened species as well as unlisted species that have some aspect that makes them sensitive, for example, poaching from nest sites. Typically, the decision to classify a species as sensitive is balanced against the potential cost and disadvantages of hiding locality information and potentially impairing conservation efforts. Some RASLs only affect species records at certain times of the year or certain life stages, for example Birdlife Australia treats some RASL species records as sensitive only during breeding season.\nMaintaining up-to-date, public, discoverable RASLs supports better and more efficient decision- making, and more informed use and management of data.\nRASLs are maintained by all state and territory environmental agencies in Australia. Most jurisdictional RASLs are publicly available lists that delineate which species should have their geographic locations blurred (see obfuscation) or withheld entirely to prevent disturbance or exploitation of the species or the site.\nSome custodians of large species-specific datasets such as BirdLife Australia, FrogID and Butterflies Australia also maintain RASLs derived from expert opinion.\nLastly, large data aggregators also use these RASLs, for example the Atlas of Living Australia applies both jurisdictional and third-party RASLs to data."

In the following example Figure 1 (figure one taken from Chapman 2020), two alternative means of taking individual observations and generalising them to a grid are shown.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: (Taken from Chapman 2020 – please note that this is not figure one in this framework)\n\n\nEither of the above generalisation techniques, rounding (A) or the provision of records as grid square polygons (B) are preferred, if data are to be passed between systems that may then apply their own additional obfuscation.

These are:\n\n2.3.1 3.1 Legal Contract –\nA dataset containing information that has legal conditions over its use. This might include a negotiated legal contract or a standard form data licence agreement that in effect is a legal contract limiting the transfer of the data to a third-party. Examples include data gathered under a signed contract with a third-party contractor or data from a research project provided under legal or licence agreement that relates to control of third-party data use. This limits who else the data can be shared with. It does not concern data where there are informal agreements in place.\n\n\n2.3.2 3.2 Legal Financial –\nA dataset that is commercial-in-confidence until an economic decision has been made or is part of current financial negotiations whereby transfer could compromise a financial process such as a tender. Such data are normally subject to an embargo period after which it may be released. For example, a company has access to data about endangered species in relation to a development they are involved with where third-party knowledge of that data (by competitors) might impact the economic viability of the project. This dataset might be embargoed until a certain date.\n\n\n2.3.3 3.3 Non-legal –\nA dataset that was acquired via an informal agreement that the information would not be transferred. Typically, this relates to third parties such as data from a landholder, data from a researcher who has not yet published or similar. As an example, a researcher working on a PhD project has a significant number of observations about a new species. The researcher is happy to share the data but does not want the data to be made public until after the publication of their results. An alternative example might be a researcher’s data where the location can be revealed but other fields such as measurements must be withheld. This dataset might be embargoed until a certain date."

Species-related categories are:\n\n2.4.1 4.1. Location data –\nA dataset that contains species where access to information about their exact location causes sensitivity. This includes:\n\ndivulging exact location of a species where factors such as geographically restricted distribution, recent discovery, life history stage, reproductive habits, feeding habits or vulnerability to human interference may compromise conservation / management efforts where that information is not already in the public domain. Most jurisdictions and major data custodians maintain sensitive species lists containing species that meet this definition which require active record management. For example, the exact location of a critically endangered plant or animal is withheld to prevent exploitation, theft for illegal trade, vandalism, the risk of disease posed by visitation and habitat destruction.\n\nmanagement factors that make the record sensitive. This includes records on private land that interfere with privacy, or where the records are sensitive. To protect the plant, animal, habitat, or people, coordinates for the species are obfuscated.\n\n\nFor both i) and ii), an alternative to obfuscating or withholding the record, may be to accurately communicate the location but obfuscate the identification of the species, to avoid incidental damage such as to a nest tree in a forestry harvesting plan or roadside spraying and slashing.\n\n\n2.4.2 4.2 Identification data –\nSpecies whose identification has major economic, legal, or financial ramifications at a jurisdictional level, if the species name or location is exposed. This particularly refers to species which, if reported, are extremely sensitive, causing major issues at state, territory, or national scale. For example, there are highly invasive species that are spreading internationally that do not occur in Australia. These species present potential major biosecurity risks to Australian natural resource industries such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries and Australia’s unique plants and animals. Incursions of these species are dealt with swiftly and decisively by eradication. However, publicly available historical records about an incursion that was wiped out can cause confusion over whether the species is active in Australia. Locations of incursions for these species may be withheld for the economic well-being of a jurisdiction.\n\n\n2.4.3 4.3 Attribute data –\nData where metadata about the record in one or more attribute fields adds additional sensitivity. This generally means that the species record itself is not sensitive, but there is information attached to the record, such as breeding information, that make it easy to disturb the animal or important elements of its habitat. Other examples include culturally sensitive information or the location of pest control activities e.g. baiting / poisoning programs that the landowner might be worried about sharing because of tampering with baits. This may require similar approaches to location related data, where the location must be accurately communicated but species identity obfuscated."

    "text": "4.5 Receiving Access Requests\nThe Australian Best Practice Guide to Applying Data Sharing Principles suggests the logical fields for a data request. Requests for RASD should meet the following criteria:\n\ndefine a geographic / taxonomic area of interest – the request form should ask data requestors to define the geographic / taxonomic extent of their request.\n\ndemonstrate an appropriate aim – the request should clearly articulate the aim of the intended use. For research, the aim should include a statement on the topic of the research; for industry use, the request should specify the type of activity data are being sought for.\n\ndemonstrate a public benefit – the request should clearly articulate what public benefit is derived by accessing the data and the expected outputs and outcomes.\n\nshow that legal, ethical, and moral considerations (including CARE principles) have been addressed – how should the request ensure that the data are not misused? Particularly, the data requestor has to make a statement on how they should protect the data from being accessed inappropriately.\n\nstate what data should be used and why it’s required - the request should clearly articulate for what purpose RASD is required. For research, this should include a description of the project and expected outcomes; for industry use, the request should specify the type of activity and location.\n\nstate the timeframes for which the user needs the data\n\nstate who (both the entity requesting the data and nominated responsible individual within the entity) will be working on the project\n\ndemonstrate feasibility – the data requestor needs to demonstrate that the requested data are suitable for answering the stated aims of the project.\n\n\nNormally, requests meeting criteria and requesting access to a localised geographic area, or data for a single or small group of species should be approved. Requests for data at a jurisdictional or national level should receive greater scrutiny.\nAn objective of data requests under the framework should be to prevent restricted data being passed to third parties or entering the public domain.\nA best practice guide to fields for an electronic form meeting these requirements is available in Supplement 9.\nIf a data requestor has identified as an Indigenous body or organisation on the data access request form, and they have not previously been subject to a breach, every effort should be made by the data custodians to facilitate the sharing of data with the requestor."

Usage terminates at the end of the specified period\n\naccess to a subset of the dataset (e.g. a specified local area or all data relating to a species or group of species for a specified period) – this covers most use cases from research and commercial end users\n\naccess to a protected environment where data can be queried but not copied – this covers the alternative to level two, where commercial interests or research users wanting relatively fast access to large datasets can enter a protected environment, interrogate data, but not download a copy. Derived products such as models may be downloaded (this option is currently not widely available)\n\n\nGenerally speaking, individuals should not be recognised as Approved Data Requestors because of the legal complexities surrounding data access. This means a university school, rather than a PhD student, would be signatory, with the expectation that the university will take responsibility for ensuring that the student uses the data legally and responsibly. All Approved Data Requestors should preferably only be able to acquire data if they sign a negotiated legal agreement (not a standard form data licence agreement) controlling data use (Supplement 2 and Principle: Sharing or Restricted Access Species Data Should be Through Negotiated Legal Agreement.\nInstances where Approved Data Requestors breach legal agreement conditions may result in the Requestor having their agreement revoked.

This framework encourages the use of these agreements instead of Standard Form Data Licence Agreements.\n\n\nNew Data\nData acquired after a data custodian has decided to act consistently with this framework.\n\n\nObfuscation\nThe practise of rounding or randomising, according to an agreed standard, the geo- localities in a dataset to make it difficult to discern the original geo-locality. Randomisation has benefits for map display but is not a robust data management approach in a data ecosystem. Rounding or the provision of records as grid square polygons is preferred if data are to be passed between systems that may then apply their own additional obfuscation.

RASD categories are defined in Table 1.\n\n\nRestricted Access Species List (RASL)\nRASLs, also known as sensitive species lists, are maintained by each jurisdiction in Australia. A jurisdictional RASL is a publicly available list that delineates which species should have their geographic locations blurred or obfuscated to prevent disturbance or exploitation of the species or the site. In addition, Third-party data custodians (including individuals) may have their own RASLs.\n\n\nSpecies\nIn the context of this framework, species refer to all species, subspecies or infraspecies, including (where identified under RASLs) populations, varieties, and phrase name taxa.\n\n\nStandard Form Data Licence Agreement\nA license used between most data custodians and repositories, which uses standard (non-negotiable) terms and conditions to stipulate management of data including to control end user use of data.\n\n\nTransformation\nThe practice of modifying the fields or data in a dataset.

Text in [square brackets] needs to be replaced when the agreement is being prepared.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition\nExample Clause(s) to Add\nGuidance\n\n\n\n\nProvision of Data\n\n\n\n\nHow and in what timeframe will the Data be delivered to the Receiver?\nThe Supplier will transfer the Data to the Receiver on [insert the date when the Data will be provided] by [describe the manner in which the Data will be transferred to the Receiver].\nA clause should be included specifying when and how the Data are to be provided.\n\n\nWho is responsible for ensuring that the Data are de-identified and that there are no -party restrictions on the transfer of Data?\n1. The Supplier must ensure that the Data are de-identified, and that it has the right to transfer the Data to the recipient.\n\n2. Notwithstanding clause 1, if any personal information is incorporated in the Data, each party must, in dealing with that personal information:\n(a) promptly notify the Supplier that the Data includes personal information;\n(b) comply with all laws applicable to that party (including, without limitation, privacy laws and data protection laws) which regulate the collection, storage, use and disclosure of Personal Information;\n(c) promptly notify the other party of any complaint or investigation under, or relating to, any breach of the foregoing laws in relation to that information; and\n(d) reasonably cooperate with the other party in resolving any such complaint or investigation\nThis reflects the onus outlined in the Framework.\n\n\nIs the Data to be held longer term and updates provided periodically?\n(a) At the Receiver’s written request, which may only be made [stipulate agreed frequency of these requests], the Supplier will provide updates of the Data to the Receiver.\n(b) After receiving the written request under paragraph (a) and subject to paragraph (c) below, the Supplier will use reasonable efforts to provide the updates of the Data promptly.\n(c) The Receiver acknowledges that the updates of the Data may contain data (such as Indigenous data or -party data) that requires changes to the conditions placed on the use of Data under this Agreement. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to vary this Agreement before the updates to the Data are released.\nThis clause can be used to specify the frequency of updates e.g. annually or two times in a calendar year.\n\n\nUse of Data\n\n\n\n\nWhat can the Data be used for?\n1. The Receiver will only use the Data for the Purpose.\n\n2. No right, licence or ownership is granted to the Receiver in relation to the Data and any Intellectual Property in the Data, except as set out in this Agreement.\nThe purpose of this clause is to specify how Data can be used and to make clear that there are no additional rights to the Data or any IP in the Data.\n\n“Purpose” should be defined in the agreement. Thought should be given to whether Derived Products may be produced from the Data.\n\n\nAre there restrictions on the use of the Data?\nThe Receiver will not use the Data for the following purposes\n(a) [e.g. commercial purposes\n(b) aggregation with other datasets for the purpose of publication;\n(c) teaching;\n(d) producing Derived Products; and\n(e) publication].\nThe purpose of this clause is to emphasise how Data cannot be used. Note that this clause operates in addition to the stipulation of what Purposes the data can be used for. As such, there is no need to be exhaustive. It can be used to stipulate uses that are of particular concern.\n\nIf there is Indigenous data contained within the Data, any conditions requested by Indigenous peoples should be stipulated here.\n\nNote regarding “commercial purposes”: if commercial purposes are to be excluded, consider whether this needs to be defined. In particular, if the Receiver is a forprofit it may be necessary to carve out specific commercial uses that are not permitted.\n\n\nIs there Indigenous data within the Data with discreet restrictions on use?\nThe Receiver acknowledges that the Data contains Indigenous data. The Receiver agrees that it will not use the Data for the following purposes without first speaking to the relevant Indigenous communities:\n(a) [stipulate any matters for which Indigenous peoples requested to be consulted e.g. commercial purposes or aggregation with other datasets for the purpose of publication]\nData Custodians will need to consult with Indigenous peoples prior to release of Data containing Indigenous data. In some cases, Indigenous peoples might agree to the use of Indigenous data for certain purposes. If so, those conditions can be listed in the clause in the row above (“Are there restrictions on the use of the Data?”)\n\nHowever, in most cases, it will be appropriate for the Receiver to consult with Indigenous peoples before certain uses are made. Such conditions should be addressed in this clause.\n\n\nDoes the Data contain third-party datasets?\nThe Receiver acknowledges that the Data includes third-party data that can only be used for the Purposes defined in this Agreement.\nA clause similar to this should be included in cases where the Data includes third-party data.\n\n\nIs access to the Data required for more than one individual?\n1. The Receiver must create the following roles to manage access to the Data:\nAdministrator\n- Role: Assigns roles to other Authorised Users and manage Authorised User access\n- Access rights: Full access to Data including read / create / delete / update.\nGeneral user\n- Role: Uses the Data for the Purpose (or aspects of the Purpose)\n- Access rights: Able to query and analyse but not edit the Data.\nDeveloper\n- Role: Uses the Data for the Purpose (or aspects of the Purpose)\n- Access rights: Able to query and analyse but not edit the Data. Able to create and publish Derived Products. Able to integrate and query Data with other datasets.\n\n2. The Receiver must maintain a record of Authorised Users, roles assigned to each Authorised User (as provided in clause 1) and what Data are accessible to each Authorised User.\n\n3. The Receiver must ensure that each Authorised User is only given the Access Rights and the Data that the Authorised User needs for their role.\n\n4. Before the Receiver provides Authorised Users with access to Data:\n(a) the Receiver must ensure that Authorised Users understand and are able to comply with the Data use obligations in this Agreement; and\n(b) the Receiver must maintain a documented record (co-signed by the Administrator and the general user or developer, as applicable) of the Authorised User’s understanding, including a description of the Data use obligations.\nIn some cases, more than one individual within a Receiver’s organisation will need access to the Data. In such cases a clause should be included to specify how Data should be managed by the Receiver.\n\nA possible definition of ‘Authorised User’ is “An employee, director, officer or student of the Receiver that needs, and is granted, access to Data by the Receiver and who is assigned a role under clause X of this Agreement”.\n\n\nAre there restrictions to Data being passed to third parties by the receiving Approved Data Requestor?\nWhere Data must not be provided to third parties\nThe Receiver acknowledges and agrees that the Data are being provided for use by Authorised Users only. The Receiver agrees that it has no right to provide the Data or any sub-set of the Data to any third-party and that it has no right to sub-licence any of its rights under this Agreement.\n\nWhere Data can be provided to third parties\n\n[Option A]\n(a) If the Receiver wishes to pass Data received under this Agreement to a third-party, the Receiver must first obtain the express written permission of the Supplier. The Supplier may withhold permission at the Supplier’s discretion.\n\n[Option B]\n(a) The Receiver may pass Data received under this Agreement to a third-party provided that the Receiver first notifies the Supplier of the third-party.\n(b) Before any Data are provided to a third-party, the Receiver must:\n(i) enter into a written agreement on terms that are similar to, consistent with and at least as onerous as the terms of this Agreement; and (ii) ensure that:\nA. no legal restrictions on the use of the Data are breached by providing the Data;\nB. the Data are cited and attributed correctly; and\nC. the Data does not contain any Personal Information.\nA clause should be included to address whether Data – that is, the untransformed Data received from the Data Custodian – can be provided to third parties.\n\nIf Data can be provided to third parties, the clause should specify the circumstances under which Data may be transferred.\n\nTwo potential approaches are suggested. Another approach would be to permit Data to be passed on to certain categories of third parties or for certain usages only.\n\n\nAre there restrictions to Derived Products being passed to third parties by the Approved Data Requestor?\nWhere Derived Products must not be provided to third parties\n\nThe Receiver agrees that it has no right to provide Derived Products to any third-party.\n\nWhere Derived Products can be provided to third parties\n(a) [Option A] Subject to clause (b) and (c) [amend as appropriate], the Receiver may provide Derived Products to a third-party.\n(b) [Option B] If the Receiver wishes to provide Derived Products to a third-party, the Receiver must first obtain the express written permission of the Supplier. The Supplier may withhold permission at the Supplier’s discretion.\n(c) Before any Derived Product is provided the Receiver must ensure that:\n(i) the location of restricted access species or sensitive attributes relating to them cannot be derived from the Derived Product;\n(ii) no legal restrictions on the use of the Data are breached by providing the Derived Product;\n(iii) the Data are cited and attributed correctly in the Derived Product; and\n(iv) the Derived Product does not contain any Personal Information.\n\n[Where an embargo period applies prior to release of a Derived Product]\n(a) The Receiver will not release any Derived Products to the public or to third parties prior to [DD/MM/YYYY].\nA clause should be included to address whether Derived Products can be provided to third parties.\n\nHere Derived Products means any dataset or product that is produced using or derived from the Data including transformed data and models.\n\nIf Derived Products can be provided to third parties, this clause should stipulate the conditions of release including any embargo periods, what transformations are to be applied and what output checks are required before the Derived Product is released.\n\n\nWhat must the Receiver do to protect the Data?\nThe Receiver must maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to:\n(a) protect the Data from loss or misuse;\n(b) ensure that the Data are only accessible by Authorised Users; and\n(c) protect the Data from unauthorised use, modification, or disclosure [including (without limitation) through the measures stipulated in clause [refer to “Is access to Data required for more than one individual at the Receiver?”] of this Agreement].\nThe approach in the Example Clause does not stipulate that the Data are held in a certain location; rather it stipulates that however the Data are held, the Data must be afforded certain protections.\n\nWhere there are multiple users of the Data at the Receiver, the bracketed text should be included, which provides a cross reference to the provisions under the Condition “Is access to Data required for more than one individual at the Receiver?”.\n\n\nTerm and termination\n\n\n\n\nIs the Data for a specified project with an agreed defined timeframe in which the Data are to be used?\nThis Agreement will commence on the Delivery Date [the agreed date for delivery of the Data by the Data Custodian to the Receiver] and end on [DD/MM/YYYY], unless terminated earlier under clause x of this Agreement.\n\n\n\nIs the Data for an agreed range of uses that are ongoing, such that an option to extend the term of the agreement should be included?\nThis Agreement will commence on the Delivery Date [the agreed date for delivery of the Data by the Data Custodian to the Receiver] and end on [DD/MM/YYYY], unless terminated earlier under clause x of this Agreement. This Agreement may be extended for a further [stipulate time period] by mutual written agreement.\nClause specifying option to extend the term of the Agreement.\n\n\nWhat are the consequences of termination of the Agreement (either because the term has expired, or the Data Custodian has terminated the Agreement)?\n1. If this Agreement is terminated or the term has expired, [except to the extent the Data has been incorporated into a Derived Product consistent with the terms of this Agreement]:\n(a) the Receiver must immediately stop using the Data;\n(b) any right or licence granted to the Receiver in relation to the Data and any Intellectual Property in the Data, expires; and\n(c) [subject to clause 2,] the Receiver must destroy all copies of the Data on the Receiver’s systems and devices within 7 days of the date of termination\n\n[2. The Receiver may retain one copy of the Data with the project file for a period of [specify period] after the end date of this agreement for the sole purpose of [specify the reason that the Data can be retained]. The Receiver must maintain the safeguards outlined in clause [“What must the Receiver do to protect the Data?”] for the duration of this period.]\nThis clause should address what the Supplier requires the Receiver to do with the Data upon termination of the agreement. If relevant, this clause will need to take into account Data that has been legitimately incorporated within Derived Products.\n\nConsider whether the Receiver will need to retain a single copy of the Data for a specified purpose and a specified period of time.\n\n\nWhat are the consequences of breach of agreement conditions?\n1. If the Data Custodian reasonably determines that the Receiver has:\n(a) used the Data for any purpose other than the Purpose [; or\n(b) passed the Data to a third-party; or\n(c) passed a Derived Product to a third party,]\nthe Data Custodian may immediately terminate the Agreement by written notice.\n\n2. The Receiver acknowledges and agrees that in the event that the Data Custodian reasonably determines that the Receiver has committed a serious or repeated breach of the conditions of use outlined in this agreement:\n(a) the Data Custodian may notify other Data Custodians that are signatories to the Framework that the Receiver has committed a serious or repeated breach of the conditions of Data use contained in this Agreement; and\n(b) the Receiver’s behaviour may be taken into account by other signatories when assessing future requests from the Receiver to access restricted access species data from other signatories.\nA clause should be included to specify what circumstances warrant immediate termination of the agreement.\n\nThe text in brackets will only be appropriate if the agreement restricts third-party access to Data and/or Derived Products.\n\n\nGeneral provisions\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the mechanism for handling any disputes that arise under this Agreement?\n(a) Any dispute, controversy, difference, or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and/or the subject matter of this Agreement, including its existence, breach, validity, or termination (Dispute), must be dealt with in accordance with this clause.\n(b) Nothing in this clause prevents any Party from seeking urgent injunctive or similar interim relief from a competent court.\n(c) Any of us claiming that there is a Dispute must notify each other in writing and give details of that Dispute to each other’s contact person.\n(d) Within 30 days of the date that the written notice of the Dispute is received, the Director, CEO or equivalent of each Party, or their delegates who have appropriate authority to resolve the Dispute, will conduct a meeting by telephone or video conference in an effort to resolve the Dispute. Each Party will bear its own costs of that meeting.\n(e) If the Dispute is not resolved within 90 days from the date that the written notice of the Dispute is received, then the Dispute must be submitted to mediation in accordance with, and subject to, the Resolution institute Mediation Rules. The mediation must take place in Sydney, Australia and be administered by the Resolution Institute.\nA dispute resolution process should be included in the agreement.\n\n\nWhat assurances does the supplier provide in relation to the Data?\n1. The Receiver acknowledges its use of the Data is at its own risk and accepts that the Supplier, to the fullest extent permitted by law, is not liable (whether in tort (including negligence), contract, statute or otherwise) for any direct or indirect loss or liability arising from Receiver’s use of the Data.\n2. The Supplier makes no warranty or any representation in respect of the Data, including any warranty or representation that the Data are accurate, is of a certain quality, or is fit for any particular purpose.\n3. To the extent permitted by law, the parties exclude all warranties or other terms which otherwise might be implied in this Agreement.\nIn most cases, it will not be appropriate for the Supplier to provide any warranty as to the quality or fitness for purpose of the Data. The Data are provided ‘as is’."

    "section": "Restricted Access Species (Currently Known as Sensitive Species) Lists",
    "text": "Restricted Access Species (Currently Known as Sensitive Species) Lists\nDefines Restricted Access Species and provides best practice advise on sharing restricted access species lists and data transformations to be applied to them.\n\n\na) Newly Described Species\nThese are species which have been recently described, have very high levels of uncertainty about their vulnerability to disturbance, and have not yet been assessed for inclusion on a RASL. In the rare event where a species meets these criteria, they may be dealt with consistently with the processes outlined for RASL species below.\n\n\nb) Definition of Restricted Access Species (Currently Known as Sensitive Species)\nRestricted Access Species are species identified by a jurisdiction or a third-party data custodian in Australia as requiring restricted access to geolocational or identity information on the species. These are described in the Principle Restricted Access Species Data (RASD) Should be Consistently Classified and are generally species that have undergone expert assessment according to a defined process and are held as lists (RASLs). RASLs may relate to either conservation-related species or biosecurity-risk related species. This framework currently only covers conservation-related RASLs.\n\n\nc) Management of Jurisdictional Restricted Access Species Lists (RASLs)\nRASLs are maintained by each jurisdiction in Australia. A RASL is a publicly available list that delineates which species should have their geographic locations obfuscated or withheld to prevent disturbance of the species or for management reasons. Users and data custodians should always check with the originating data custodian that the list is up to date. RASLs serve an essential purpose in ensuring that data from all sources relating to a restricted access species are treated in a similar fashion in that jurisdiction. This is essential, firstly to ensure the management intent behind the RASL is achieved and secondly to ensure that a particular observation that may enter an aggregated data source from several sources, when obfuscated, appears as the same point.\n\n\nd) Management of Third-party RASLs\nIn some instances, non-government data custodians may maintain a RASL with similar intent to jurisdictional RASLs but at variance to jurisdictional lists. An example might be a bird dataset where nest tree locations must be withheld, location obfuscated, or the species identity obfuscated. An alternative might be the records of a local orchid society, where obfuscation of all records is a prerequisite of access.\nThird-party RASLs are the prerogative of an organisation, however, organisations intending to create or maintain these lists should be cognisant of the risks:\na) The effectiveness of independent third-party RASLs may be compromised where such lists are at odds with jurisdictional lists. A mixture of obfuscated and unobfuscated records may allow a user to identify a locality by triangulation or data linkage.\nb) Because third-party datasets are frequently sought by many aggregators or projects, there is an implicitly higher risk of third-party RASLs resulting in a particular observation entering an aggregated data source from several sources, and when obfuscated, appearing at a different point, confusing analysis.\nNevertheless, third-party RASLs serve an important purpose in giving organisations sufficient reassurance to share data. The importance of third-party RASLs are recognised as an important mechanism for ensuring that the maximum amount of data are included in management and research. Third-party data custodians who work consistently with the principles in this framework are strongly encouraged to seek amendments to jurisdictional RASLs rather than maintaining separate RASLs.\nWhere third-party RASLs are inevitable, either\na) these lists are provided to other data custodians so that the best-practice rules identified under this framework are applied consistently but are flagged so that users can discern that obfuscation of this data may divert from other data\nb) the third-party data custodian applies the best-practice rules identified under this framework but are similarly flagged so that users can discern that obfuscation of this data may divert from other data\n\n\ne) Location generalisation (Obfuscation) on Jurisdictional RASLs\nAll states and territories in Australia manage data on species in RASLs by obfuscation of locality information or by preventing queries on data below a minimum radius of 1km.\nWhere RASD needs to be transformed spatially as per jurisdictional or third-party RASLs it should be transformed via obfuscation. Obfuscation ideally needs to be conducted so that the same observation point, regardless of source, is spatially moved to a consistent spot to avoid confusion.\nBest practice for obfuscation, therefore, needs to:\na) be deterministic and repeatable so that a transformed point, regardless of source, will end up at the same point\nb) minimise the flow-on risk of double obfuscation\nc) allow modellers to use the obfuscated data with confidence, provided that their grid cell is larger than the obfuscation algorithm\nThere are two levels.\nLevel 1 – round latitude and longitude to nearest 1 decimal place\nLevel 2 – round latitude and longitude to nearest 2 decimal places\nWhere possible, it is desirable to represent obfuscated records as polygons rather than points i.e.. a 0.01 x 0.01 degree square or a 0.1 x 0.1 degree square with the centroid defined by the obfuscation treatment above. For example: where the RASL dictates that location coordinates should be obfuscated to 1 decimal place, and returns a value of latitude -30.5 longitude 148.7 this would be represented by a 0.1 x 0.1 degree square with centroid at -30.5, 148.7. Accordingly, the polygon would have minimum Latitude -30.55, maximum Latitude - 30.45, minimum Longitude 148.65, maximum Longitude 148.75. Jurisdictions should advise whether Level 1 or Level 2 is required for each species via RASLs. The instances where obfuscations are applied are outlined in Supplement 5.\n\n\nf) Attribute Generalisation on Jurisdictional RASLs\nThe rulesets which apply to RASLs may include generalisation / withholding of some attributes for particular species as outlined under Species-related categories in Principle Restricted Access Species Data (RASD) Should be Consistently Classified. Where information for a particular attribute has been removed, row level metadata should reflect that this has occurred and the ruleset for this change. Reasons should be standardised and align with the species-related categories in Principle Restricted Access Species Data (RASD) Should be Consistently Classified. The instances where generalisations are applied are outlined in Supplement 5.\n\n\ng) Generalisation on Third-Party RASLs\nGeneralisation rulesets which apply to Third-Party RASLs should follow the same methodologies as outlined in e) and f) for jurisdictional RASLs above.\nData custodians are expected to apply a third-party RASL ruleset to that third-party’s dataset."

    "text": "(Version 1/12/2022)\nThe intent of this framework is specifically to encourage data custodians to maximise the sharing of higher risk data within a trusted environment by constraining access to that environment and ensuring that public access to all higher risk data are either obfuscated or withheld.\nThere is a category of data – or datasets – that carries an implicitly higher risk of consequences when shared due to management, access concerns, policy, legal or financial requirements. This excludes Personal Identifiable Information, and information is available about PII in Supplement 3.\nThis type of data are best handled by curtailing access and is therefore called withheld data.\nThe Australian Government Best Practice Guide to Applying Data Sharing Principles notes that it is best practice for data custodians to explore how they can share data legally rather than simply dismissing a request to access data due to perceived legislative restrictions.\nThere are four levels of withheld data recognised by this framework and Table 1 (referred to below) is available in the Principle Restricted Access Species Data (RASD) Should be Consistently Classified.\n\ncannot be shared at all with third parties, even other jurisdictions – typically this should be data relating to a small subset of species under extreme risk of exploitation or harm whose distribution is so restricted or sensitive that knowledge shared unnecessarily places the species at risk (Category 3.1 (b) in Table 1)\ncan be shared with jurisdictions and approved data requestors under negotiated Legal Agreement but not with other users. Typically this should be Legal Contact or Financial issue datasets (Category 2.1 and 2.2 in Table 1), non-Legal Third-party issue datasets (Category 2.3 in Table 1), data relating to “sensitive” species (Category 3.1 (a) in Table 1), where the implications of sharing species data has ramifications at a national scale such as an incursion of an extreme biosecurity risk species (Category 3.2 in Table 1), or where the attribute of a species record makes a record sensitive (Category 3.3 in Table 1)\ncan be shared with approved data requestors under negotiated Legal Agreement provided the source data are not duplicated and not accessible by general users. This is the same as (b) but access to the data are constrained to allow analysis but not data downloading or transfer\ncan be viewed by the public. This data has had all possible data transformations applied including systematically obscured geolocations\n\nThere is a 5th category of withheld data, Embargoed Data, being data that has a timestamp preventing its release before a certain date. As the intention is to release this data in due course, it is dealt with by providing metadata reflecting this (see Supplement 8). Levels a), b) and embargoed data fall within the definition of usage-restricted data.\nData custodians are encouraged to work towards the provision of full resolution data (comprising all data except (a) above) when providing data under negotiated legal agreements and the application of data transformations consistent with this framework when providing public data."

Species locations are available publicly e.g., via published journal articles\nHandling of both data types:\nData should be made publicly available subject to obscuring locations consistent with the Framework. The dataset should be annotated to record the dataset has been modified.\n\nThe restricted dataset with full locational data are available under legal agreement to all approved users under the Framework.\nOfficial: (not sensitive – low impact)\nInformation from routine business operations and services. Information is available from published literature such as original species descriptions. The information needs management but is not sensitive.\n\n\n4.1 (b) Location\nThe location of a species requires withholding to minimise risk to species or people. Species locations are not available from any source\nHandling of both data types:\nData should be made publicly. available subject to obscuring locations consistent with the Framework. The dataset should be annotated to record the dataset has been modified.\n\nThe restricted dataset with full locational data are available only within jurisdictions on an as needs basis under negotiated legal agreement between parties.\nOfficial: Sensitive – low to medium impact\nLimited damage to entity operations is a degradation in organisational capability to an extent and duration that, while the entity can perform its primary functions, the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced and/or minor loss of confidence in government.\n\n\n4.2 Identification\nSpecies whose occurrence has economic or legal ramification if disclosed\nHandling of both data types:\nThe restricted dataset with full locational data are available only within jurisdictions on an as needs basis under negotiated legal agreement between parties.\nOfficial: Sensitive – low to medium impact\nLimited damage to entity operations is a degradation in organisational capability to an extent and duration that, while the entity can perform its primary functions, the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced and/or minor loss of confidence in government. Limited damage to entity assets or annual operating budget is equivalent to $10 million to $100 million.\n\n\n4.3 Attribute\nThe metadata or attribution associated with a species record adds additional sensitivity\nHandling of both data types:\nAt the discretion of data custodians / agencies, the restricted dataset with full attribution is available under negotiated legal agreement to all approved users under the Framework.\nOfficial: Sensitive – low to medium impact Information compromise may cause minor loss of confidence in government."
