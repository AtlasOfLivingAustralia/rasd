## Overview

The RASD backend is a Python 3.9 AWS Lambda which uses FastAPI and Mangum and
is deployed with Pulumi.

## Architecture

This application uses a variety of technologies in order to be deployed in a serverless environment, whilst still being
developed as a regular FastAPI application.

### Application

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) REST API ASGI application
- [Mangum](https://mangum.io/) as an adapter for running ASGI applications in AWS Lambda

### Structure

- Structure of application is adapted from [`full-stack-fastapi-postgresql`](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql/tree/0.5.0/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D/backend/app)
- The code itself is nested within a `lambdas` directory, as it was originally expected that the project would require
  multiple lambdas (which was not the case).

```

### Development Tools

- [`poethepoet`](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) as a quick and easy task runner
- [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/) & [`pytest-cov`](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for unit testing and coverage
- [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for type-checking analysis
- [`ruff`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for linting

## Environment Variables

In order to run the RASD backend, there are a number of required environment variables that **must** be set.
The backend includes a `.env.example` file, which serves as a template for the _current_ required environment variables.
This file should be copied to a `.env` file, and the values replaced with real credentials provided by an administrator.
For an up-to-date list of all environment variables, see the `lambdas/rasd_fastapi/core/settings.py` file.

## Development

### Requirements

This project requires:

- Python 3.9
- Poetry

### Installation

To install the dependencies for this project:

```shell
# Ensure your current Python version is 3.9
$ pyenv local 3.9

# Install dependencies using Poetry
$ poetry install

# Enter the Poetry virtual environment shell
$ poetry shell
```

### Tasks

This project uses `poethepoet` as a quick and easy task runner.
To see the existing tasks check the `pyproject.toml` or use:

```shell
$ poe --help
...
CONFIGURED TASKS
  serve
  test
  type
  lint
  clean
```

### Development Server

To start a local development server using `uvicorn`:

```shell
$ poe serve
```

Note that in order to run the application, there are required environment variables that must be set.
See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section above for more details.

### Unit Tests

To run the unit-test suite:

```shell
$ poe test
```

### Type Checking

To run the type-checker over the codebase:

```shell
$ poe type
```

### Linting

To run the linter over the codebase:

```shell
$ poe lint
```

### Clean

To clean the backend directory, and remove caches and build artifacts:

```shell
$ poe clean
```

## Build & Deployment

This serverless application is deployed using `Pulumi`.
Please see the top level `README.md` file for build & deployment instructions using Pulumi.
Note that it is not recommended to build or deploy locally, and the below instructions are provided at the user's risk.

### Local Building

To build the backend in your local environment for deployment:
1. Follow the [installation instructions](#installation) section above
2. Run `LAMBDA_NAME=rasd_fastapi bash build-backend-wrapper.sh local`
3. The built `dist/rasd_fastapi/` directory will be created

### Local Deployment

To deploy the built backend from you local environment:
1. Ensure `Pulumi` is installed
2. Ensure you you have credentials for your targeted stack in `~/.aws/credentials`
3. Select the desired stack (e.g., `pulumi stack select dev`)
4. Run `pulumi preview` to check if your credentials are valid
6. Run `pulumi up` to deploy the code.
